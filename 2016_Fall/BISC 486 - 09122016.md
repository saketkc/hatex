Cas9 - Double strand breaks
Guide RNA - Sequence speicifc finding, recruit CAS9

Longer regions of homology for insertion

Specificity in insertion of GFP  -> Arms should be homologous -> The longer these arms -> Higher chances of biniding

guideRNA + Cas9 -> requires palindromic site -> Should be of type NGG

Q5. Two introns with one exon -> Exon2 will be chucked out by non homologousm or it will cleav target2/target1


## Experimental approaches to analyze development, maintenance, and repair processes

- FACs - Fluroscence activated cell sorting 
- Stem cell for bllod -. hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
- Individual blood systems -> limited life span -> But remaking cells for many years all of donor type ->
Must be one or more stem cell types repopulating the blood --> How to identify live cells?
- Live cells: Can the cells reconstitute the hemapoietic stem cell system?
- How would you know that right cells were being enriched? You have live cells -> require fewer and fewer cells to
reconstitute whole blood system
- Stem Cells -> Individual or as a popsulation can produce differentiated progeny and reproduce themselves

If you label proteins on surface of cell -> That is viable

FACs:

- Fluroscent antibody binds to surface of cells
- In cell sorter, channel through the nozlle contains all type of cells
- Fluosrescent group gives negative charge so it is attraced to the positive field
- Use specificity of antibodies towards surface proteins to separate certain cells from others
- Can be used to separate different populations based on intensity level of flurosence 

In hemaotpoetic transpant, a lot needs to be transplanted because the probability of individual cell proliferating
is low

## Identifying genes of interest

Mouse with no hair - Loss of stem cell which are involved in making hair

- Mutagenesis: X rays, gamma rays -> Not useful for genetic screening because they cause large scale rearrangement of
chromosomes
- Take Male -> Insert ENU -> High level of SNVs generated in testes -> because they are constantly producing sperm -->
  
Mutate male mice -> F1 male 1/2 -> F2 female -> 1/2 -> 1/4 

AB x Ab -> Ab x AB -> Ab(0.5) F  -> AB(0.25) Ab(0.5) bb(0.25)


ALS and motor neurons
- Within spinal cord control - high level control
- If notochord is placed between -> makes population of motor nuerons on both sides -> produces something that causes the plating 

Need an assay for dorsalizing, and ventralizing factors:

Sonic hedgehog:
- Ventral morphogen
- floor plate acquires same properties as notochord
- Placing notochod right in contact -> makes moto neutrons 

## In situ hybridization

- take olig2 dna and transcribe to complementary mRNA
- Take tissue, denature all RNAase here -> Add complementary probe so that it can find out complementart mRNA ->
  Add antibody -> Colorless compound turns purple because of binding to alkaline phosphate


In situ-hybridzation -> Making nucleic acids 
Immunodetection -> much easier

## Modifying gene activity

- Muta genesis within mouse using stem cells. 
- Stem cells generated directly from blastocyst


- Homologous recombination: Targeting vector with large arms of homology -> Generate mutaton directly by swapping 
- the exon and replaced with the targeting loop
- Very rare event 
- No cutting of DNA, but just homologous recombination
- If cell doesn;t take this target loop it will die because of the antibiotic
- If there is a gene outside of homology, the genes will be remoed -> Loss of this aids surving while gain of the loop
 aids surviving. The viral gene is some kind of kinase
- Inefficient -> Requires selection for rare cells
- Problem with this approach: A lot of cells are gonna die? -> To prevent -> make conditional mutation
-
- loxP site + CRE recombinase... ?
- To study the function of gene in multo
- Only place we want to make CRE is  -> Find a promoter only in that organ  -> It will remove the function of that target gene only in that organ .
- To have temporal control => Take CreER and add protein motif that is part of Estrogen receptor -> If not bound it is
- retained in cyoplasm -> When ER comes and binds to protein it is taken inside the cell -> It causes excision inside nucleus but only in adults. ER is associated with DNa binding transcript regulation
