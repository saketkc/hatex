Electrical nature of neurons

- Na+ - K+ pump -- Na+ K= selective channels
- Concentration force pushes out while elc. pontial forces K+ inside membrane
- Why charge? Chargeexists;p
- E_k = -90mV --> amount of voltage required to oppose eclectric ponteial effects
- If inside it becomes +50mV, it is enough to precent entry of Na+
- V --> Resting pootential = > Voltage cell

- Membrane potential - Alternates between -70 to +30mV (-negative(anion) inside positive outside)
- Ions cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer, they need a channel
- Voltage-gated channels: respond to trans-membrane voltages

- Voltage gated K+ channel- Ligarnd - diffusable protein
- Ligand binding causes protein to change its shape
- Mechanicall gated channels
